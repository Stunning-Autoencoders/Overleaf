\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   
% This command serves to balance the column lengths on the last page of the document manually. It shortens the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount. This command does not take effect until the next page so it should come on the page before the last. Make sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
                                  
\section*{APPENDIX}
Appendixes should appear before the acknowledgment.

\section*{ACKNOWLEDGMENT}
The preferred spelling of the word acknowledgmen in America is without an e after the g. Avoid the stilted expression, One of us (R. B. G.) thanks . . .  Instead, try R. B. G. thanks. Put sponsor acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.
